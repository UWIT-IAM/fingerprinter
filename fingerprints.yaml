  ```yaml
  # This example has a source fingerprint that is generated for all python files
  # under the src/ directory, but the fingerprint is dependent on the
  # dependency locks. This means that even if all python files remain
  # untouched, an update to the dependencies will generate a new
  # source fingerprint.
  # `fingerprints.yaml` is also included here to ensure that changes
  # to the actual fingerprint configuration regenerates all fingerprints.
